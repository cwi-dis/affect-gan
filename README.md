# affect-gan
A framework for studying the application of Generative Models (AC-WGAN-GP) to physiological sensor data.

Built using Tensorflow 2.2 and Python.

Developed as part of my Master Thesis with [CWI-DIS](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/) entitled ["Intelligent Data Augmentation for Physiological Signals using Conditional Generative Attention Models"](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=716631).

Currently being crunched into a paper.
